# prepare data

Use Tensorflow (Keras):
* implement 1D convolutional neural network with fixed time window
* implement recurrent neural network with sigmoid (tanh) level
* upgrade to undecimated fully convolutional neural network defined in [2]
* upgrade to recurrent LSTM neural network with architeture defined in [6]
* implement ansambles of above neural networks


* Deep belief networks (DBN)
